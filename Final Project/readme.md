# Final Project
## This project is about vehicles fuel consumption and co2 emissions
<br/>
<p> Dataset Description:
<p>This dataset captures the details of how CO2 emissions by a vehicle can vary with the different features. There are total 1067 rows and 12 columns. the data can be described as follows:
<pre>
Transmission:
A = Automatic
AM = Automated manual 
AS = Automatic with selectshift 
AV = Continuously variable 
M = Manual 3 - 10 = Number of gears
</pre>
<pre>
Fuel type:
X = Regular gasoline
Z = Premium gasoline
D = Diesel 
E = Ethanol (E85) 
N = Natural gas
</pre>
<pre>
Brands = Company of the vehicle
</pre>
<pre>
Model Year = the year of release
</pre>
<pre>
Vehicle Class = Class of vehicle depending on their utility, capacity and weight
</pre>
<pre>
Engine Size = Size of engine
</pre>
<pre>
Cylinders = Number of cylinders
</pre>
<pre>
Transmission = Transmission type with number of gears
</pre>
<pre>
Fuel type = Type of Fuel used
</pre>
<pre>
Fuel Consumption City = Fuel consumption in city roads
</pre>
<pre>
Fuel Consumption Hwy = Fuel consumption in Hwy roads
</pre>
<pre>
Fuel Consumption Comb = The combined fuel consumption
</pre>
<pre>
Fuel Consumption Comb mpg = The combined fuel consumption in both city and highway is shown in mile per gallon (mpg)
</pre>
